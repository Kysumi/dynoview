# Future ideas

## General

- Allow user to create Models which would have templates for PK/SK args
  - Allow the results of a predefined query to be used for a dropdown to select parts of PK/SK string


## Models
- Allow user to define "zod" like models
  - This will allow us to highlight attributes that do not align with the real data
